		<td><p align="justify"> Enjoy the ever popular tradition of an old-fashioned bed turning, where old or unique quilts are displayed and their stories are told to the audience daily, allowing each quilt to tell its own story of who made it and the life it has lived. Your quilt can be any shape, and should be no smaller that 60" around, and no larger than 160" around. It can be any technique, and we are encouraging you to try something you haven't done before.</p></td>
