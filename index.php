		<b><p align="center">WE ARE PART OF COMMUNITY!!!</p></b>
		<p align="justify" style="font-family:Comic Sans MS"> Every year the Guild engages in service projects for the community. Of notable significance is the Guilds continuous donation of baby quilts to the Rockford Memorial Hospital Neonatal Unit.  Over the years the Guild has donated hundreds of baby quilts that are placed on the Neonatal incubators and then go home with the babies. The Guild members have also made "Quillows" for the DeKalb County Sheriff's Department.  The Guild members also make wheelchair pockets that are donated to local nursing homes for use by the nursing home residents that are confined to wheelchairs.  Each year, Christmas ornaments are donated to local nursing homes.In recent years the charity was through the local hospital foundation.Our donation initiated a program to make mammograms available to women in DeKalb County who could not afford one.</p>
